## Considerations for Neural Networks

- **Classification**: Metrics like log loss and AUC-ROC are particularly relevant for neural networks, as they align with probabilistic outputs (e.g., softmax) and gradient-based optimization. For imbalanced datasets, F1-score or AUC-PR are preferred over accuracy.
- **Regression**: MSE and RMSE are commonly used as loss functions in neural networks, but MAE or Huber loss may be chosen for robustness to outliers. R² is useful for post-training evaluation but not typically as a training objective.
- **Domain-Specific Nuances**: In multi-class or multi-label classification (e.g., in CNNs for image tasks), metrics like macro/micro-averaged F1-scores are used. For time-series regression with RNNs, metrics like RMSE or MAPE are adapted to temporal dependencies.

## Summary

Selecting the appropriate metric depends on the task, dataset characteristics (e.g., imbalance, outliers), and application requirements. For classification, precision, recall, and F1-score are critical for imbalanced data, while AUC-ROC provides a threshold-agnostic evaluation. For regression, RMSE and MAE are standard, with MAPE useful for relative errors. These metrics, implemented in libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow, guide model evaluation and optimization in neural network development.



Below is a detailed list of metrics commonly used to evaluate the accuracy and performance of classification and regression models in machine learning, including neural networks. The metrics are categorized based on their applicability to classification or regression tasks, with explanations of their purpose and mathematical formulations where relevant.

## Classification Metrics

Classification tasks involve predicting discrete class labels. The following metrics assess the accuracy and effectiveness of such models:

1. **Accuracy**
   - **Purpose**: Measures the proportion of correct predictions across all classes.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN} \)
     - \( TP \): True Positives, \( TN \): True Negatives, \( FP \): False Positives, \( FN \): False Negatives.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable for balanced datasets but misleading for imbalanced ones.

2. **Precision**
   - **Purpose**: Evaluates the proportion of positive predictions that are actually correct.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP} \)
   - **Use Case**: Important when false positives are costly (e.g., spam detection).

3. **Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate)**
   - **Purpose**: Measures the proportion of actual positives correctly identified.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN} \)
   - **Use Case**: Critical when false negatives are costly (e.g., disease detection).

4. **F1-Score**
   - **Purpose**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing both metrics.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{F1-Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}} \)
   - **Use Case**: Useful for imbalanced datasets where both precision and recall matter.

5. **Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)**
   - **Purpose**: Measures the model’s ability to distinguish between classes across all thresholds.
   - **Formula**: Area under the curve plotting True Positive Rate (Recall) vs. False Positive Rate (\( \frac{FP}{FP + TN} \)).
   - **Use Case**: Effective for binary classification and assessing model robustness.

6. **Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUC-PR)**
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on precision and recall trade-off, especially for imbalanced datasets.
   - **Formula**: Area under the curve plotting Precision vs. Recall.
   - **Use Case**: Preferred when positive class is rare (e.g., fraud detection).

7. **Confusion Matrix**
   - **Purpose**: Provides a tabular summary of prediction outcomes (TP, TN, FP, FN).
   - **Use Case**: Offers detailed insights into class-specific performance, especially for multi-class problems.

8. **Log Loss (Logarithmic Loss or Cross-Entropy Loss)**
   - **Purpose**: Penalizes incorrect predictions based on predicted probabilities.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{Log Loss} = -\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N [y_i \log(\hat{y}_i) + (1 - y_i) \log(1 - \hat{y}_i)] \)
     - \( y_i \): True label, \( \hat{y}_i \): Predicted probability.
   - **Use Case**: Common in probabilistic classifiers like neural networks with softmax outputs.

9. **Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)**
   - **Purpose**: Balances all four confusion matrix quadrants, robust for imbalanced data.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{MCC} = \frac{TP \cdot TN - FP \cdot FN}{\sqrt{(TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)}} \)
   - **Use Case**: Preferred for a single, comprehensive metric in binary classification.

10. **Cohen’s Kappa**
    - **Purpose**: Measures agreement between predicted and true labels, adjusted for chance.
    - **Formula**: \( \kappa = \frac{p_o - p_e}{1 - p_e} \)
      - \( p_o \): Observed agreement, \( p_e \): Expected agreement by chance.
    - **Use Case**: Useful for multi-class problems or when chance agreement is a concern.

## Regression Metrics

Regression tasks predict continuous values. The following metrics evaluate the accuracy of predicted values against true values:

1. **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
   - **Purpose**: Measures the average absolute difference between predictions and true values.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N |y_i - \hat{y}_i| \)
     - \( y_i \): True value, \( \hat{y}_i \): Predicted value, \( N \): Number of samples.
   - **Use Case**: Robust to outliers, interpretable as average error.

2. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
   - **Purpose**: Measures the average squared difference between predictions and true values.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \)
   - **Use Case**: Sensitive to outliers, commonly used in neural network loss functions.

3. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
   - **Purpose**: Square root of MSE, providing error in the same units as the target.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2} \)
   - **Use Case**: Preferred for interpretable error magnitude, widely used in forecasting.

4. **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**
   - **Purpose**: Measures average percentage error relative to true values.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{MAPE} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N \left| \frac{y_i - \hat{y}_i}{y_i} \right| \cdot 100 \)
   - **Use Case**: Useful when relative errors matter (e.g., financial predictions), but sensitive to zero or near-zero true values.

5. **R-Squared (Coefficient of Determination)**
   - **Purpose**: Measures the proportion of variance in the dependent variable explained by the model.
   - **Formula**: \( R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \bar{y})^2} \)
     - \( \bar{y} \): Mean of true values.
   - **Use Case**: Indicates model fit, with values closer to 1 indicating better fit.

6. **Adjusted R-Squared**
   - **Purpose**: Adjusts R² for the number of predictors, penalizing overly complex models.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{Adjusted } R^2 = 1 - \left( \frac{(1 - R^2)(N - 1)}{N - k - 1} \right) \)
     - \( k \): Number of predictors.
   - **Use Case**: Useful when comparing models with different numbers of features.

7. **Median Absolute Error**
   - **Purpose**: Measures the median of absolute differences, highly robust to outliers.
   - **Formula**: \( \text{MedAE} = \text{median}(|y_1 - \hat{y}_1|, \dots, |y_N - \hat{y}_N|) \)
   - **Use Case**: Preferred in datasets with extreme values or non-Gaussian errors.

8. **Huber Loss**
   - **Purpose**: Combines MSE and MAE, less sensitive to outliers than MSE.
   - **Formula**: 
     \[
     L_\delta(y_i, \hat{y}_i) = 
     \begin{cases} 
     \frac{1}{2}(y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 & \text{if } |y_i - \hat{y}_i| \leq \delta \\
     \delta |y_i - \hat{y}_i| - \frac{1}{2}\delta^2 & \text{otherwise}
     \end{cases}
     \]
   - **Use Case**: Used in robust regression tasks, often as a loss function in neural networks.

## Considerations for Neural Networks

- **Classification**: Metrics like log loss and AUC-ROC are particularly relevant for neural networks, as they align with probabilistic outputs (e.g., softmax) and gradient-based optimization. For imbalanced datasets, F1-score or AUC-PR are preferred over accuracy.
