Gradient Boosting is a powerful machine learning technique used for regression and classification tasks. It builds an ensemble of weak learners, typically decision trees, in a sequential manner where each new tree attempts to correct the errors made by the previous ones. This method is known for its high predictive accuracy and ability to handle various types of data.
